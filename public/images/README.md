## Image Format Recommendations

- **Format**: PNG or WebP for best quality
- **Optimization**: Compress images before adding (use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim)
- **Size**: Keep file sizes under 500KB when possible
- **Resolution**: 2x resolution for Retina displays

## Alternative: Using Figma Assets

If you're importing directly from Figma, you can export these images using:
1. Select the image in Figma
2. Right-click → Export
3. Choose PNG format at 2x scale
4. Save with the corresponding filename

## Note

These images are referenced in `/app/page.tsx`. If you change the filenames, make sure to update the imports in that file as well.
